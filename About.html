    <h1>About me!</h1>
    <p>I'm a student who's currently learning python and web design. My dream is to become a game desigtner one day, or a coder. I want to make sure that 
        I can do my best w/o having to rely so much on external help, so I know that I can at least reach some answers on my own and reach out when needed. 
	I've been trying my hardest to work on things, but my cerative skills are still....extremely lackluster so this won't be super grand or anything 
	like that, I know my own limits pretty well to know what I can or can't do.
        Hopefully this year's portfolio turns out better than the last!
    </p>
	  <p>I also have done some work in the Infy App challenge, where me and my team designed a concept andd working demo of an app called EMPOW to help empower \n students who want 
		  to work, learn financial literacy and gain more opportunities with internships, partime jobs, etc.</p>
